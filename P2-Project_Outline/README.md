## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I wanted to create an app where people can search the cities by their ratings in different categories such as safety, affordability, schools, hospitals, sociality,jobs etc. I thought seeing reviews from local people would help to others to pick best location to live. This app would help for people who relocate and don't have someone to ask for recommendation or don't have time to make a deep search about cities.

### Features
